Work experience (list job titles, employers, dates, and responsibilities)

Skills (list relevant skills or areas of expertise)

Awards, certifications, or other achievements (list any relevant awards, certifications, or other accomplishments)

Use appropriate HTML tags to format the content of each section, such as h1 for section headings and ul or ol for lists.

Save the index.html file and open it in a web browser to ensure that it displays correctly.

Add your website to your GitHub to start building your portfolio.

Requirements
In order to keep the project within scope (time, energy, resource), you can only use HTML to complete thing project. Even if you know CSS and JS (which we're assuming you don't yet), you are expected to only write the website using HTML.

Imagine you are a professional developer working on this project. There will be things you don't know, things you want to do but haven't yet learnt how to. As a professional developer, you need to know the limits of your abilities and look up other things in Google, MDN docs, the internet.-->
